        "React.js (or simply React) is a JavaScript library used for building user interfaces, especially for single-page applications (SPAs). It helps developers build interactive, dynamic, and fast web apps with reusable UI components.It was developed by Meta (formerly Facebook) and is now maintained by Meta and a huge open-source community.",

      explanation:

      explanation:

Think of components like Lego blocksâ€”you assemble them to create a full UI.Types of Components in React : 1. Functional Components (Modern & Recommended) : These are simple JavaScript functions that return JSX. 2. Class Components (Older, Less Used Today) : These are ES6 classes that extend React.Component and have lifecycle methods.",

      explanation:
        "Hooks are special functions in React that allow you to use state, lifecycle methods, and other features inside functional components. Before Hooks, these features were only available in class components. Hooks make functional components just as powerful.",

      title: "6. Types Of Hooks In React JS ? ",
      explanation:
        "âœ… 1. Basic (Built-in) Hooks: These are the most commonly used hooks that come with React. They include useState, useEffect, useContext, and more. They allow you to manage state, side effects, and context in functional components.âœ… 2. Additional Hooks (Advanced Built-in Hooks): These hooks provide more advanced functionality, such as useReducer for complex state management, useMemo for performance optimization, and useRef for accessing DOM elements or storing mutable values.âœ… 3. Custom Hooks: You can create your own hooks to encapsulate reusable logic that can be shared across multiple components. Custom hooks allow you to extract component logic into a separate function, making your code cleaner and more maintainable.",

      explanation:
        "useEffect is a React Hook that lets you perform side effects in functional components. Side effects can include data fetching, subscriptions, or manually changing the DOM. It runs after every render by default, but you can control when it runs using a dependency array. You can also return a cleanup function to run when the component unmounts or before the next effect runs. its use like :Fetching data from an API , Updating the DOM directly,Using setTimeout or setInterval, Subscribing to events or WebSocket connections, Cleaning up resources when the component unmounts.",

      title: "9. What is useContext Hook In React JS ?",
      explanation:
        "useContext is a React Hook that allows you to access the context value in functional components. Context provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level. It is useful for global state management, themes, user authentication, and more.  When to Use It : You should use useContext when you have data that needs to be accessible by many components at different levels of the component tree, such as user authentication status, theme settings, or language preferences.",

      title: "10. What is useRef Hook In React JS ?",
      explanation:
        "useRef is a hook that returns a mutable object (ref) which persists across renders. It is mainly used for: 1. Accessing DOM elements directly 2.Storing a value without re-rendering the component .",

      explanation:
        "useLayoutEffect is a hook similar to useEffect, but it runs synchronously after all DOM mutations. It is useful for reading layout from the DOM and synchronously re-rendering. It is often used for measuring the size or position of elements before the browser paints.",

      explanation: "useReducer is a hook that allows you to manage complex state logic in functional components. It is an alternative to useState and is particularly useful when the state logic involves multiple sub-values or when the next state depends on the previous one. It uses a reducer function to determine how the state should change based on dispatched actions.",

      explanation: "Redux is a state management library for React applications. It helps you manage global state in a predictable way, making it easier to debug and test your application.
